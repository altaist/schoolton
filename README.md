## About

SchoolTon is a TMA service for completing mini-courses and receiving rewards. The main concept is to create an accessible, flexible and beneficial educational ecosystem using Telegram.

Any existing offline educational center can join the project with one click and offer their courses. This allows the attraction of the audience from major educational centers.

## How to earn?
Users can earn money in several ways, making the platform attractive to both learners and educators. Learners can earn by completing courses on the platform. After successfully finishing a course with a certain score, users can receive a reward. This incentivizes students to study more diligently and achieve high results.

Users who have successfully completed courses and achieved a high score can apply to become instructors. Upon approval by the course creator, they can take part in editing courses or in educational activities. Instructors earn money for each course they conduct, motivating them to provide quality teaching and maintain high educational standards.

Course creators can also earn money by offering their courses on the platform. They receive a portion of the revenue from each student who successfully completes their course. This encourages the creation of high-quality content and attracts a larger number of students.

## Get started
Each user is given a free skin - a "Bookshelf of knowledge". By taking courses, buying power-ups, you can develop it and after reaching a certain level, you can make it a full-fledged NFT. Earnings can be withdrawn only if the user has an NFT. Each completed course is attached to it.

A separate skin is also created for teachers and course creators, which can also be developed. With a free skin, you can only create courses that are open to everyone, for paid courses you need to have an NFT. When switching from Student status to Master status, all completed courses are transferred.

Any user who has earned a sufficient number of coins can create their own course - they just need to choose a topic, and all the content will be generated automatically. The instructor can customize the course to their liking and sell access to the course or additional services to participants.

All courses and digital assets within the service are bought and sold on the internal marketplace.

## Tokenomics
SchoolTon implements a systematized concept of paying users for studying and paying for the use of digital knowledge carriers. This creates a balanced flow of liquidity within the service. The influx of liquidity into the service comes from payments for the use of unique educational content.

The system provides 2 tokens: StudentCoin is credited for completing the course, and MasterCoin is credited for participating in moderation or the learning process.

With StudentCoin, you can buy power-ups for more earnings, pay for the creation of an NFT when switching from a free skin, and buy courses. With MasterCoin, you can create your own courses, buy power-ups, and encourage teachers and moderators.

Token burning occurs during the purchase of courses and digital assets. Tokens gain liquidity as a result of the exchange and marketplace operations.
